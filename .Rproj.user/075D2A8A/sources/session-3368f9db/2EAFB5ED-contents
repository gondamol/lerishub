    ## **Programming Tools**

[**R language**](https://cloud.r-project.org/) **and [RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/#download)**

-   We will use the R language which is a **popular programming language used by statisticians and data scientists**.

-   We will use RStudio interface while using the R language.

**Git and GitHub**

-   We will use GitHub for version control with git.

-   We will soon learn what version control means.

Rmarkdown/Quarto

We can use RMarkdown for all kinds of everyday tasks like:

-   Writing shareable R code with full text comments

-   Automating the production of fully-formatted PDFs, Word, and Excel files

-   Building interactive Shiny applications for data exploration

-   Even [running Stata code](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/eng-stata.html) from a local installation of `StataSE-64.exe`
